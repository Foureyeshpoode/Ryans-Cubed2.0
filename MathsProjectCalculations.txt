Scaling issue for random number generator in java
Java only allows a double random number generator to be between 0-1
The code used to correct this was:
double start = 0.56;
double end = 0.97;
double random = new Random().nextDouble();
double result = start +  (random * (end - start));
return result;

Investment Calculations for each stock
Apple:
lowest point - 0.56%
highest point - 0.97%
Microsoft:
lowest point - 2.62%
highest point- 16.43%
Tesla:
lowest point- 17.6%
highest point - 29.1%
Netflix:
lowest point- 1.1%
highest point- 49.7%

How the investment was calculated was done by using the random number genrator to pick a number between highest and lowest 
and then multiply that by the amount that was originally invested
Example:
Apple stock was chosen
1000 was entered as currency
random number genertor chose 0.6706%
returned result was 1006.70
profit was 6.70
